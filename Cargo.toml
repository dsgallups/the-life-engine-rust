# Your web builds will start failing if you add a dependency that pulls in `getrandom` v0.3+.
# To fix this, you should tell `getrandom` to use the `wasm_js` backend on Wasm.

# in your rustflags for both local and CI/CD web builds, taking into account that rustflags specified in
# multiple places are NOT combined (see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5376>).
# Alternatively, you can opt out of the rustflags check with this patch:
